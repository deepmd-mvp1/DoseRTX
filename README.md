# rtdose-prediction
Unbiased 3D Dose Prediction

Adding codes by Navdeep developed for RT dose prediction paper.
Current codes handle CT/OAR/PTV inputs with/without beam for
both manual and echo doses. All codes used to prepare inputs, 
data pre-processing, and computing various metrics for paper
are also included. Running some experiments, for e.g. adding
DVH loss will require minor modifications to the code rather
than just changing some settings from outside.
------------------------------------------------------------
Added my anaconda environment.yaml file to see requirements.
All the installed packages are probably not needed to run these
codes. We can try to run one of the experiments and keep installing
dependencies based on the errors we get. Will take a few minutes
extra but will save the conda environment from becoming cluttered.
